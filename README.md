Server and Client will communicate each other over sockets using python programming.
These Programs were mainly used in IoT models.

First identify the server IP address.
Please enter this IP address in both server and client programs.

At Server, create a socket and bind the ip address with a port number. And, then wait for new connections.
At Client, create a socket and connect to the server with the ip address of server and send data.

First run server.py, and later run client.py
